What is CSS in JS?

~

**NOT** inline styles

~

Write your CSS using JavaScript
* Colocate styles with the component

~

No more global namespace
* No time spent on naming classes

~

Easy to locate dependencies
* We import and export modules/constants

~

Dead code elimination
* Dead code never gets to the browser

~

Sharing constants
* Constants are shared across components

~

Non-deterministic Resolution
* Styles are loaded with the component

~

Isolation
* The CSS is isolated in the component
